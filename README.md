## ðŸ‘‹ Hello, internet visitor!

I'm [Ben Aubin](https://benaubin.com), a CS student at [The University of Texas at Austin](https://cs.utexas.edu/~bean)

I believe code, carefully cultivated, can make the world better. 

I'm especially interested in systems programming, as well as giving consideration to the human and business impacts of what we create.
