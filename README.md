### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I create software and run businesses because code, carefully cultivated, can make the world better.

I'm building [actors.dev](https://actors.dev), a serverless platform that enables the next generation of services.

I'm the CEO of [Mintere](https://mintere.com), a digital marketing startup. We're building tools that will revolutionize how businesses find and interact with their customers online.

I'm a senior at [EA Young Academy](https://eayoungacademy.com), and nervously awaiting college decisions.

Current stack: Rust, Rails, React, Relay, GraphQL, NodeJS
